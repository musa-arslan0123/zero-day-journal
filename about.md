Hi, I’m Musa. I work Service Desk and I’m moving into Cyber. This blog is my public notebook.

**What you’ll find here**
- Short summaries of labs I complete (TryHackMe, HTB, home labs)
- Gotchas, mistakes, and fixes
- Networking and Linux refresh notes
- EDR and SIEM learnings (e.g., SentinelOne, Defender, Splunk)

If you’re hiring and want to chat, reach out on LinkedIn.
