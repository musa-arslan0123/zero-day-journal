I’m Musa. I work on a Service Desk and I’m moving into cyber. This site is my public notebook.

**What I publish**
- Quick lab notes (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, home labs)
- Networking and Linux refresh
- EDR and incident response notes (SentinelOne, Defender)

**Why**
- Keep momentum with small, consistent posts
- Turn notes into something useful for others (and interviews)
