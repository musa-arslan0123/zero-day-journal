# DNS: The Internet’s Phonebook (With Attitude)

Before DNS, the internet was like trying to text your friend using only their bank account number.  
Enter **DNS (Domain Name System)** — the magical directory that lets you type **tryhackme.com** instead of `104.26.10.229` and still reach the right server.

DNS is basically the internet’s version of “I’m terrible with numbers, just give me names.”

## Domain Name Basics (Who’s Who)

### TLD (Top-Level Domain)
The **last name** of a website.  
- `tryhackme.com` → the `.com` part is the TLD.  
- Two main species roam the internet:  
  - **gTLDs (Generic)**: `.com`, `.org`, `.edu` — the classics.  
  - **ccTLDs (Country Codes)**: `.uk`, `.ca`, `.au` — flying the flag for their countries.  
- Modern internet chaos: `.club`, `.ninja`, `.coffee` … because why not.

---

### Second-Level Domain
The **first name** of the site.  
- `tryhackme.com` → `tryhackme` is the second-level domain.  
- Can use a–z, 0–9, and hyphens — but no weird stuff like spaces or starting/ending with `-`.  

---

### Subdomains
The **nicknames**.  
- `admin.tryhackme.com` → `admin` is a subdomain.  
- You can stack them: `jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com` (up to 253 characters).  
- Popular ones:  
  - `mail.example.com` → email server  
  - `shop.example.com` → online store

## DNS Record Types (The Cast)

| Record      | Job Description                                                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A**        | Points a name to an IPv4 address (e.g., `104.26.10.229`).              |
| **AAAA**     | Same thing but for IPv6 (e.g., `2606:4700:20::681a:be5`).              |
| **CNAME**    | “Ask that other guy” → one name points to another.                     |
| **MX**       | Mail servers for the domain. Comes with **priority numbers** so backups kick in. |
| **TXT**      | Random text data: email validation, domain ownership checks, SPF records, etc. |

## A DNS Request: The Journey of a Lifetime  

When you type `tryhackme.com`, here’s what happens:  

1. **Local Cache:**  
   Your computer checks its own memory first. “Do I already know this one?”  

2. **Recursive DNS Server:**  
   Usually run by your ISP (or Google/Cloudflare). If cached there → done.  

3. **Root Servers:**  
   If not, the recursive server asks the internet’s top bosses:  
   > “Hey Root, where do I find `.com` stuff?”  

4. **TLD Servers:**  
   The `.com` servers reply:  
   > “Go ask these guys; they’re in charge of tryhackme.com.”  

5. **Authoritative Server:**  
   Finally, the server holding the actual records answers:  
   > “Okay, here’s the IP address you’re looking for.”  

6. **Caching:**  
   Everyone remembers the answer for the **TTL** period so next time is faster.

## Why Caching Saves Your Sanity  

Without caching:  
- Every page load = talking to the Root, TLD, and Authoritative servers again.  
- The internet would be slower than dial-up on a rainy day.  

With caching:  
- Your ISP and your own computer remember answers for a while → fewer lookups → faster websites.

## The Big Picture  

DNS is the friendly translator between **humans** (“tryhackme.com”) and **machines** (`104.26.10.229`).  
Without it, the internet would be a giant spreadsheet of numbers nobody wants to memorise.
