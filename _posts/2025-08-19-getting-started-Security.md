Quick plan for this blog.

## Focus areas
- CompTIA Security+ study (threats, identity, cryptography, secure design)
- Operating system security (Windows/Linux hardening, permissions, logging)
- Cloud and identity basics (Azure/AWS IAM, MFA, policies)
- Labs (TryHackMe → HTB → home lab)
- Tools in practice (SentinelOne, SIEM, Wireshark, Nmap)
- Incident response mindset (triage, containment, documentation)

## Posting format
- What I tried
- Wins and blockers
- 2–3 takeaways
- Next steps

This will stay short and consistent.
