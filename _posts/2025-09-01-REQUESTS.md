# HTTP: The Web’s Delivery Service

Back in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee and his team invented **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** — the rulebook for moving web pages, images, videos, and memes across the internet. Every time you open a website, your browser and a web server have a polite conversation using HTTP.

## HTTP vs HTTPS: Locked vs Unlocked

- **HTTP:** Like sending a postcard — anyone along the way can read it.
- **HTTPS:** Like sending the postcard in a locked briefcase with a fake moustache.

HTTPS encrypts data so nobody can peek in or impersonate the website. That little padlock in your browser? That’s HTTPS keeping things private.

## URLs: The Internet’s Treasure Maps

A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is basically instructions for finding stuff on the web. Here’s what the parts mean:

| Part            | What It Does                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Scheme**        | Protocol to use → `http`, `https`, `ftp`          |
| **User**          | Username (and sometimes password) for login       |
| **Host**          | The domain name or IP address                     |
| **Port**          | Defaults: `80` for HTTP, `443` for HTTPS          |
| **Path**          | The file or resource location on the server       |
| **Query String**  | Extra instructions like `?id=1`                   |
| **Fragment**      | A bookmark to a specific section of the page      |

Example:  
`https://admin:secret@mysite.com:443/blog?id=1#comments`

## Making a Request: The Web’s Handshake

A simple request:  
`GET / HTTP/1.1`

But for full websites, we need more details — this is where **headers** come in.

**Example Request:**
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/

markdown
Copy code

**Example Response:**
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98

markdown
Copy code

Then comes the actual content — the HTML page, images, or data you requested.

## HTTP Methods: The Browser’s To-Do List

| Method      | What It Means                                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **GET**     | Fetch data → “Show me the page.”                 |
| **POST**    | Send data → “Here’s a new blog comment.”          |
| **PUT**     | Update data → “Change my username to Bob.”        |
| **DELETE**  | Remove data → “Delete my embarrassing comment.”   |

---

## HTTP Status Codes: The Web’s Mood Rings

| Code Range      | What It Means                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **100–199**      | Informational → Rare these days          |
| **200–299**      | Success → Everything worked fine         |
| **300–399**      | Redirection → Page moved somewhere else  |
| **400–499**      | Client Error → “You messed up.”          |
| **500–599**      | Server Error → “I messed up.”            |

Common ones you’ll see:

- **200 OK** → All good  
- **201 Created** → New resource created  
- **301 Moved Permanently** → Page moved for good  
- **302 Found** → Page moved, but might be back  
- **400 Bad Request** → Something’s wrong with your request  
- **401 Unauthorized** → Log in first  
- **403 Forbidden** → No permission, even if logged in  
- **404 Not Found** → Page doesn’t exist  
- **500 Internal Server Error** → Server broke  
- **503 Service Unavailable** → Overloaded or down for maintenance  

---

## Headers: The Extra Info Packets

**Request Headers** → Sent by your browser:
- **Host:** Which site you want (servers host many)
- **User-Agent:** Your browser name/version
- **Content-Length:** Size of data being sent (if any)
- **Accept-Encoding:** Compression formats supported
- **Cookie:** Your saved session data

**Response Headers** → Sent by the server:
- **Set-Cookie:** Stores info on your computer for next time
- **Cache-Control:** How long to keep this in your browser cache
- **Content-Type:** Tells your browser how to handle the data (HTML, JSON, images)
- **Content-Encoding:** Compression used (e.g., gzip)

---

## Cookies: The Web’s Memory Chips

HTTP is *stateless* → it doesn’t remember who you are between requests.  

Cookies fix this by storing small bits of data on your computer, so websites can:
- Keep you logged in
- Remember settings (dark mode, language)
- Track visitors (sometimes too much…)

Each request sends cookies back to the server so it knows who’s talking.

---

## Summary

- **HTTP/HTTPS** → How your browser talks to servers
- **URLs** → Maps for finding stuff online
- **Methods & Status Codes** → The verbs and responses of the web
- **Headers & Cookies** → Extra details and memory between requests  

Next time you load a website, remember: there’s a polite digital conversation happening behind the scenes.
