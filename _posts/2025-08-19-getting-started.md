Quick plan for this blog.

## Focus areas
- Networking refresh (ports, TCP/IP, DNS, routing)
- Linux basics (permissions, services, shell)
- Labs (TryHackMe → HTB → home lab)
- EDR/IR notes from SentinelOne

## Posting format
- What I tried
- Wins and blockers
- 2–3 takeaways
- Next steps

This will stay short and consistent.
