# Cyber Journey Blog (GitHub Pages Starter)

This is a minimal Jekyll blog for GitHub Pages. It uses the official **minima** theme and includes a starter post and template.

2. Upload the contents of this zip to the repo root.
3. In GitHub, go to **Settings â†’ Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Set **Branch** to **main** and **/ (root)**, then **Save**.
6. After it builds, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

### Add a new post

- Create a file under `_posts` named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
